#Version Compatibility

##Compatibility with Tyk
Tyk Operator can work with all version of Tyk beyond Tyk 3.x+. It is tested with Tyk 3.x, Tyk 4.0.x (LTS version), and latest patch version Tyk 4.x. 
Since Tyk is backward compatible, you can safely use the latest version of Tyk Operator to work with any version of Tyk. However, if you're
using a feature that was not yet available on an earlier version of Tyk, e.g. Defining a Subgraph with Tyk 3.x, you'll see error on in Tyk 
Operator controller manager logs.

See Release notes to check for each Tyk Operator release, which version of Tyk it is tested against.

##Compatibility with Kubernetes Version

See Release notes to check for each Tyk Operator release, which version of Kubernetes it is tested against.
