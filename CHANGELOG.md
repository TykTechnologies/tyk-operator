# Changelog

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/tree/HEAD)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/compare/v0.17.0...HEAD)

## [v0.17.0](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/tree/v0.17.0)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/compare/v0.16.0...v0.17.0)

**Updated**:
- Updated Kubernetes versions used in CI for testing to ["v1.25.0", "v1.26.0", "v1.27.0", "v1.28.0", "v1.29.0"]

**Fixed**:
- Fix creating duplicated APIDefinitions on Tyk in case of cluster failures. If network errors happen while updating the 
APIDefinition, Tyk Operator retries the reconciliation based on the underlying error type [#679](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/pull/679)

## [v0.16.0](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/tree/v0.16.0)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/compare/v0.15.1...v0.16.0)

**Fixed**:
- Fixed a bug that prevents Tyk Operator to work with SecurityPolicy in CE (OSS) Mode.
Now, SecurityPolicy controller will not modify `spec.MID` (`_id`) field in SecurityPolicy.

**Added**:
- Added `imagePullSecrets` configuration for ServiceAccount in Tyk Operator Helm chart 
- Added `tyk` to `categories` field of CRDs. So, from now on, all CRs related to Tyk Operator is grouped
into `tyk` category and can be displayed via `kubectl get tyk`.
- Added support of analytics plugin
- Added `global_headers` support for UDG API Definition
- Added `detailed_tracing` of APIDefinition for OpenTelemetry

**Updated**
- Updated Go version to 1.21

## [v0.15.1](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/tree/v0.15.1)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1)

**Fixed**:
- Fixed typo in environment package name

**Changed**:
- Updated golang.org/x/net to v0.13.0

## [v0.15.0](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/tree/v0.15.0)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/compare/v0.14.2...v0.15.0)

**Added**
- Added `disabled` feature in `validate_json` field of APIDefinition. 
- Added a new Status resource called `latestTransaction` to the APIDefinition CRD which holds information about 
last reconciliation. Now, any error can be observed there instead of checking Tyk Operator logs.
- Added an option to enable `ServiceMonitor` in helm charts, in order Prometheus Operator to scrape `/metrics` endpoint.
- Added `extraVolume` and `extraVolumeMounts` options to the helm chart. So, extra volumes can be mounted in Tyk Operator's manager pod, e.g., self-signed certificates.


**Fixed**
- Check if certificate already exists on tyk before uploading
- Operator throwing lots of errors "the object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again" while reconciling security policy

## [0.14.2](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/tree/v0.14.2)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/compare/v0.14.1...v0.14.2)

**Fixed**
- Fixed panic of snapshot tool

**Changed**
- Changed optional fields of type string and bool to pointers for APIDefinition and Security Policy Custom Resources
- Updated `.spec.graphql.supergraph.subgraphs[].headers` field to allow null values for validation. In the previous
versions of Tyk such as v4.0 where `.spec.graphql.supergraph.subgraphs[].headers` is not supported, exporting such 
resources by using Snapshot tool, sets these values to null since they are not introduced in v4.0. Allow `headers`
field to accept `null` values to overcome validation issues.

**Added**
- Added possibility to set base identity provider
- Added two new Status fields to ApiDefinition and Security Policy CRDs - `latestTykSpecHash` and `latestCRDSpecHash` 
to store hash of the lastly reconciled resources. It will be used in comparison to determine sending Update calls
to Tyk Gateway or Dashboard or not.

## [v0.14.1](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/tree/v0.14.1)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/compare/v0.14.0...v0.14.1)

**Fixed**:
- Operator removes `spec.contextRef` from SecurityPolicy CRs.
- Fixed panic happening when adding an ApiDefinition and Ingress with HTTPS when operator talked to OSS gateway

**Updated**:
- Run tests against latest k8s(v1.26.3) and tyk versions(v5.0)
- Updated go version from 1.17 to 1.19

**Removed**:
- Operator is no longer tested against k8s v1.19.16

## [v0.14.0](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/tree/v0.14.0)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/compare/v0.13.0...v0.14.0)

**Updated**:
- Test each PR against Tyk v4.0 as well.
- Allow Snapshot tool to filter by category regardless of the flags set
- Documentation of snapshot tool, in order to explain how to use Snapshot with Docker.
- Remove hardcoded TLS keys from integration tests to prevent possible CI failures.

**Added**

- Added hostNetwork Support [Issue #532](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/issues/532)
- snapshot tool can be used with Docker images. 
- snapshot tool can now export only SecurityPolicy objects without specifying
  additional flag for ApiDefinition export.
- Publish docker image for arm64 too during release.

**Fixed**:
- Remove ORGID from SecurityPolicy CRs while using Snapshot tool [#577](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/pull/577).
- Prevent reading Kubernetes config while using `operator snapshot` as a CLI command
(this means you don't need to have a running Kubernetes cluster when running `operator snapshot`).
- Fixed reconciliation failures when ApiDefinition does not exist on Tyk storage.
- Fixed BDD tests dependency of `curl`. Instead of running `curl` within a container,
implemented a port-forward mechanism to send raw HTTP requests to pods.
- Fixed extra Update calls to Tyk GW / Dashboard. If no changes are made to 
ApiDefinition resource, Operator won't send a request to Tyk GW / Dashboard.
- Updated `control-plane` labels from `controller-manager` to `tyk-operator-controller-manager`
to avoid selector issues.
